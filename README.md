# 🧱 DiscordMessageComponents
Java Library for Discord message object creation
A Java Library which allows you to create discord message-related objects:
- Webhook Message
- Embeds 💬
    - Author 🧑🏻
    - Body 📝
    - Fields 🔖
    - Images 🌆
    - Footer ⏰
- Attachments 🗂️

...and serialise them into JSON strings later!

Of course, you can manually construct a Java map for a discord webhook message / embed / etc and serialise it with google Gson, but this library simply tries to make it easier.

Also this is just a good opportunity for me to learn Java. ☕️
